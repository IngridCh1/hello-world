I´m Ingrid, I´m studying CIT and this is my last semester to get a Certificate, that´s really exciting since last year I dind´t even know something like this even exist. 
I started looking for some information for a friend and by a "mistake" I got enrroll on an EDX course: CS50. I started lo to learn about computers, programing, tech and I love it!! So I decided to change my major.
